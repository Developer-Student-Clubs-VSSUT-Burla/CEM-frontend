# VSSUT Events - A College Event Management System

Initiated with the incentive to provide a common rostrum to host all college events, College Event Management (CEM) System is basically a platform where people can host their events and promote them for the students within the institute. One has to just create his/her account in CEM, then login to host his/her event and manage it as per his/her requirements. The entire process will save lot of time along with providing a better reach to the participants.

This repository is concerned to the frontend part of the project. CEM frontend provides an adaptive user interface with navigating menus and sliders, along with eye-catching graphics that brings better versatility to the user.

For those interested in working on the backend part of the project, do checkout the backend repository [here](https://github.com/Developer-Student-Clubs-VSSUT-Burla/CEM-backend)
